Learn coding by having fun!

In order to mastering a tool, you need to go through the documentation.

And here is where we fit, when you open a documentation page is full of distractions, and if you are a human you probably get bored in the
first few methods.

Also we know that doing quizzes or a lot of questions is more than boring, you probably will be able to do it for a couple of 
days, but in the long term it won't work!

Our goal is to make API's easy to learn by having the documentation in cards, kind of a game, one card at least per day,
so users don't have to dedicate more than 30 seconds a day, easy right?

This is not even close to becompleted yet, but the idea is:
1. Learn by filling the database!
2. This is meant to be a mobile app (probably we will be pushing it out through Cordova, or any other..)
3. We will be pushing a notification based on a configuration X times a day with a card, the front of the card is the title
and the back will be the content, if you think you already learn the card, just click on "Saved in Mind"
This is so we don't show the card anymore in a period of time (configurable?)

* I am staring with angular 1.6.2, just because I was learning it in deep, but we are doing a script for Node.js which 
has the option to export as json, any framework can be added ( some might not fit well with the structure, we can have that as a separate thing.)
